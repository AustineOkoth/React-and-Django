A blog capable of performing CRUD operations coded using React and Django (python)
In this project I have used React.js (as the frontend) and Python based framework Django to build a web application that is capable of performing Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) operations.

*** Requirements ***

Ensure that Python is installed and properly setup in your machine. Have Django installed. Install the django-rest-framework.
The approprite routes are located in ReactFrontend/src/components/App.jsx The Django framwork is responsible for creating the model used and the database used to store the data.
